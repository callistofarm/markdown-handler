Includes Planner Initiation Workflow.1. Purpose and Scope1.1 PurposeThis Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the formal, auditable process for the entire lifecycle of the Platform Admin (OPS-03) role when acting as a Tailscale Administrator. This role possesses high-privilege access, including user onboarding/offboarding, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) management, and Access Control List (ACL) edit rights.This SOP enforces the Principle of Least Privilege and ensures compliance with ISO 27001 requirements for Privileged Access Management (PAM).1.2 ScopeThis SOP applies to all personnel granted the OPS-03 (Platform Admin) role within the COMPANY Australia Cloud/On-Prem SCADA stack.2. Roles and ResponsibilitiesRoleRole IDResponsibilitiesSecurity Compliance NoteRequestorN/AInitiates the request for privileged access or network changes.Must provide clear business justification via Microsoft Planner.Approving ManagerOPS-03Verifies and approves the need for privileged access.Enforces separation of duties.Security LeadOPS-03Grants final approval, oversees provisioning, and audits the ACL GitHub repository.Accountable for overall system security.Tailscale AdminOPS-03Executes user management, RBAC, and manages the ACL Change Management Process.Accountable for adherence to access policy.3. Approval and Vetting (ISO 27001 A.9.2)3.1 Pre-Approval RequirementsBefore provisioning a new Platform Admin, the candidate MUST satisfy the following criteria:Business Justification: A formal request ticket in Jira Service Management detailing the necessity and expected duration of the privileged access.Background Check: Verification of "Enhanced Security Screening" status in the HRIS (SAP SuccessFactors).Competency: Successful completion of the "Zero Trust Admin" training module.3.2 Two-Person Approval RuleApproval Chain: The request SHALL be approved sequentially by the Line Manager and the Head of SecDevOps.Audit Trail: Both approvals MUST be explicitly recorded within the Jira Ticket before technical provisioning can commence.4. Onboarding and Provisioning (ISO 27001 A.9.4)4.1 Credentialing and AccessIdentity Source: The Administrator's identity MUST be managed via Microsoft Entra ID. Direct local accounts are prohibited.Authentication: Access to the Tailscale Console is granted solely via SSO, enforcing Phishing-Resistant MFA (FIDO2/YubiKey).Privilege Assignment:Add user to Entra ID Group: SEC-OT-OPS-03-ADMIN.Verify: Ensure SCIM propagation grants the Admin role in Tailscale within 15 minutes.4.2 Operational TrainingThe new Administrator SHALL complete an orientation session covering:Console Operations: Device approval, key expiry, and log review.ACL Syntax (HuJSON): Proper use of Tags, Groups, and the autoApprovers directive.GitOps Workflow: Managing ACLs via Pull Request in the company-tailscale GitHub repository.Emergency Procedures: "Kill Switch" activation and "Break Glass" recovery protocols.5. Periodic Access Review (ISO 27001 A.9.2.5)The necessity of the Administrator role MUST be formally reviewed every 90 days.Trigger: Drata automatically creates an "Access Review" task for the Head of SecDevOps.Verification: The reviewer confirms the user is still active and requires the role for their current duties.Certification: The review is signed off in Drata.Remediation: If the role is no longer required, the Offboarding Procedure (Section 6) is triggered immediately.6. Offboarding and De-Provisioning (ISO 27001 A.9.2.6)6.1 Immediate RevocationUpon notification of termination or transfer:Entra ID: Remove user from SEC-OT-OPS-03-ADMIN group.Tailscale Console: Verify session termination. If the user has active sessions on critical nodes, use the "Log out everywhere" function.GitOps: Revoke Maintainer access to the tailscale-acls repository.6.2 Key RotationIf the offboarded Administrator had access to Reusable Auth Keys or API Secrets:Rotate the TAILSCALE_API_KEY stored in GitHub Actions Secrets immediately.Regenerate any shared Subnet Router auth keys they may have handled.7. ACL Change Control (ISO 27001 A.14.2)All changes to the Tailscale ACL (policy.hujson) are High-Risk. To balance operational agility with rigorous audit requirements, a Hybrid Initiation Workflow is mandated.7.1 Critical Maintenance: API Key RotationThe GitHub Action used to publish ACLs relies on a TAILSCALE_API_KEY stored in GitHub Secrets.Rotation Frequency: Every 90 Days.Responsibility: OPS-03 Admin.Process: Generate new key in Tailscale Admin Console -> Update GitHub Secret -> Trigger test build.7.2 Change WorkflowStage 1: Request Initiation (Microsoft Planner)Actor: Requestor (Any Authorised Staff).Action: Create a task in the "Tailscale Change Management" bucket in Microsoft Planner.Required Data: Source Tag/IP, Destination Tag/IP, Port/Protocol, and Business Justification.Objective: Allows project staff without Jira licenses to submit requests.Stage 2: Triage & Formalisation (Jira Service Management)Actor: Platform Admin (OPS-03).Action: Review the Planner task. If valid, the Admin SHALL manually raise a Jira Change Request (CR).Traceability: The Jira CR MUST reference the Planner Task ID in the description to maintain the audit chain.Stage 3: Technical Execution (GitOps)Actor: Platform Admin (OPS-03).Code: Create a Git Branch (referencing the Jira CR ID) -> Edit policy.hujson -> Commit.Validation: Automated pipeline runs tailscale acl check.Approval: A peer OPS-03 Admin must review and approve the Pull Request (PR) in GitHub. Self-approval is prohibited.Deployment: Merging the PR automatically pushes the policy to the Tailnet.Closure: Close the Jira CR and the Planner Task.
