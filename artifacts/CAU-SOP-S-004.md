Onboarding and Provisioning (ISO 27001 A.9.2)Policy Mandate: Users SHALL NOT create their own LastPass accounts. Provisioning MUST be executed via Microsoft Entra ID SCIM Automation.3.1 Initiation & ApprovalRequest: Requestor submits a task in the "Access Management" bucket in Microsoft Planner.Required: User Name, Role (e.g., "Platform Engineer"), Required Folder Access (e.g., "OT-Site-A-Secrets").Approval: Approving Manager (OPS-03) verifies the request against the user's job description and marks the task "Approved".3.2 Identity Provisioning (SCIM)Entra ID Action: The Platform Admin adds the user to the SEC-OT-OPS-XX Security Group in Microsoft Entra ID.Automation: The Entra ID Enterprise App "LastPass" automatically provisions the user account via SCIM.Pre-requisite: The user MUST have MFA (Microsoft Authenticator) enabled on their Entra ID account before LastPass access is granted.3.3 Shared Folder Access (RBAC)Access to secrets is governed by Shared Folders mapped to Roles. Direct sharing of individual items is discouraged.Folder NameAudienceContent TypePermissionGlobal-ReadAll StaffWiFi PSKs, Non-Critical PortalsRead-OnlyOT-EngineeringOPS-02/03PLC Passwords, HMI LoginsRead-Only (Hidden Passwords)Cloud-RootOPS-03 OnlyAzure Break Glass, Root KeysRead/WriteExecution: The Admin manually assigns the user to the relevant Shared Folder within the LastPass Console or via Entra ID Group Mapping (if configured).4. Operational Usage & Hygiene4.1 Master Password PolicyRequirement: Users SHALL set a strong, unique Master Password (min 14 characters) upon first login.Prohibition: The Master Password MUST NOT be stored in clear text or reused from other accounts.4.2 Offline Access (OT Safety Interlock)Critical Requirement: In the event of an internet outage or Entra ID failure (preventing SSO), operational staff MUST maintain access to local OT credentials (e.g., PLC logins) to ensure plant safety.Configuration: The "Permit Offline Access" policy SHALL be enabled for OPS-02 and OPS-03 roles.Procedure: Users SHALL log in to the LastPass Extension at least once every 14 days while online to cache their vault locally.5. Access Rights Review (ISO 27001 A.9.2.5)The necessity of continued access to privileged Shared Folders MUST be reviewed periodically.Frequency: Every 90 Days.Trigger: Drata automatically creates an "Access Review" task.Verification: The Head of SecDevOps reviews the "Users" list in the LastPass Admin Console against the active HR roster.Remediation: Users found to have excessive permissions or who have changed roles are removed from the relevant Shared Folders immediately.6. Offboarding and De-Provisioning (ISO 27001 A.9.2.6)Timely de-provisioning is mandatory to prevent unauthorised access to shared secrets.6.1 Immediate RevocationTrigger: HRIS notification or Service Desk Ticket.Action: Platform Admin removes the user from the SEC-OT-OPS-XX group in Microsoft Entra ID.Result: Entra ID SCIM sends a "Disable" signal to LastPass. The account is suspended immediately.Kill Sessions: The Admin SHALL manually force a "Destroy all sessions" command in the LastPass Console to sever any active offline tokens.6.2 Account DeletionRetention: Suspended accounts are retained for 30 days to allow for data recovery if required.Deletion: After 30 days, the account is permanently deleted.7.
