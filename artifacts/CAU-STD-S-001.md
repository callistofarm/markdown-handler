Extracted from [CAU-MAN-S-001]. |1. PurposeThe purpose of this standard is to define the mandatory configuration state for the "Cloud/On-Prem SCADA" infrastructure. It establishes the immutable technical baselines for hardware, operating systems, and network security policies required to maintain a Zero Trust architecture in compliance with ISO 27001:2022.2. ScopeThis standard applies to all Level 3 On-Prem Gateways and Level 3.5 Cloud Core infrastructure managed by the OT SecDevOps function. It defines the "Target State" that must be enforced via Infrastructure-as-Code.3. Normative References & ComplianceThe architecture is validated against the following controls.| Framework | Control / Function | Implementation Mechanism || ISO 27001:2022 | A.8.20 (Networks security) | Zero Trust Overlay (Tailscale) independent of physical transport. || ISO 27001:2022 | A.8.22 (Segregation of networks) | Strict Micro-segmentation (ACLs) and Local Firewall (UFW) default deny. || ISO 27001:2022 | A.8.25 (Secure development lifecycle) | Infrastructure-as-Code (Packer), Container Signing (Cosign). || ISO 27001:2022 | A.5.15 (Access control) | Tailscale SSH (Just-in-Time) eliminates static credentials. || NIST CSF v2.0 | PROTECT (PR) | Immutable OS images, Device Isolation via Defender for Endpoint. || IEC 62443-4-1 | SD-1 (Secure Development Process) | Automated pipelines with SAST (Dependabot) and SCA. |4. Architectural StandardsThe system adheres to a modified Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA).Level 3.5 (Cloud Core): Hosted in Microsoft Azure (Australia South-East). Contains the Central SCADA Gateway, SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel), and Artefact Repositories (GHCR).Level 3 (On-Prem DMZ): The Industrial On-Prem Gateway (Ubuntu LTS). Acts as the secure boundary.Data Flow: All inbound/outbound traffic is routed via the Encrypted Overlay (Tailscale).Exceptions: Strictly filtered egress paths are permitted for NTP Time Synchronisation (Stratum 2) and Ignition Licensing verification.Level 2 (Control): PLCs and Legacy HMIs. No direct internet access. Communicate solely with the Level 3 On-Prem Gateway via local LAN.5.
