Context and Scope1.1 PurposeThis document serves as the formal Risk Register for the COMPANY Australia SCADA Cloud/On-Prem SCADA software stack. It records identified information security risks, evaluates their potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability, and physical safety, and defines the treatment plans required to reduce residual risk to an acceptable level.1.2 ScopeThis register covers the entire lifecycle of the SecDevOps platform, including:Assets: On-Prem Gateways, Cloud Infrastructure (Azure), CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub), and Personnel.Threats: State-sponsored actors, cyber-criminals, insiders, and environmental failures.Boundaries: From the L2 (PLC) Network interface up to the L3.5 (Cloud) boundary.2.

Risk Assessment MethodologyRisks are evaluated using a qualitative matrix overlaying standard ISO 27001 impact criteria with IEC 62443 Safety/Reliability consequences.3.1 Impact CriteriaLevelDescriptionSafety/OT Consequence (IEC 62443)CriticalCatastrophic failure."Loss of Control (LoC), Damage to Equipment, or Threat to Life."HighMajor operational disruption."Loss of View (LoV) > 1 Hour, Loss of Historian Data."MediumSignificant degradation."Loss of Redundancy, Loss of Non-Critical Monitoring."LowMinor inconvenience.Procedural workaround available; no operational impact.3.2 Risk Acceptance ThresholdCritical/High: Unacceptable. Mandatory remediation or Executive Risk Acceptance required.Medium: ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable). Treat if cost-effective.Low: Acceptable. Monitor.4. Risk RegisterRisk ID: R-001 | Supply Chain Compromise of Base ImageAsset: On-Prem Container Runtime (Docker)Drata Mapping: DCF-15 (Separate Development), DCF-64 (Vuln Mgmt)Threat Scenario: Threat actor compromises the upstream inductiveautomation/ignition:8.3.0 image on Docker Hub before ingestion.Inherent Risk: CRITICAL (Potential Remote Code Execution on On-Prem Gateway).Control Measures (Implemented):Universal Image Strategy: Use of specific version tags (no :latest) aligns with DCF-15.Soak Testing: Mandatory 14-day soak test in UAT Ring (Ring 1) before Production promotion.Container Signing: Cosign implementation verifies internal artefacts.Residual Risk: LOWRisk Owner: OPS-03 (Platform Admin)Status: TreatedRisk ID: R-002 | Unauthorised Firmware/OS ModificationAsset: On-Prem Node (Advantech UNO/MIC)Drata Mapping: DCF-107 (Device Security), DCF-109 (Asset Mgmt)Threat Scenario: Insider or intruder with physical access to the remote mine site alters the BIOS or OS boot order.Inherent Risk: HIGH (Loss of View, potential safety interlock override).Control Measures (Implemented):Immutable OS: OS generated via Packer; runtime mounted Read-Only.Hardware Watchdog: adv_wdt enabled in BIOS/OS triggers reset on tampering/hang.Alerting: Disconnection triggers "Device Isolation" in Sentinel (DCF-109).Residual Risk: MEDIUMTreatment Plan: Requires physical chassis tamper seals (Physical Security Control).Risk Owner: Site Superintendent / OPS-02Status: In Progress (Due: Q1 2026)Risk ID: R-003 | Lateral Movement from Corporate IT to SCADAAsset: SCADA Pipeline (Overlay Network)Drata Mapping: DCF-105 (Segregation of Networks), DCF-42 (Access Control)Threat Scenario: Ransomware infection in Corporate IT spreads via shared IDP or workstation to the OT network.Inherent Risk: CRITICAL (Encryption of Historian, Lockout of Control).Control Measures (Implemented):Zero Trust Overlay: Tailscale ACLs enforce "Default Deny" (DCF-105).Identity Segregation: Corporate users have NO route to tag:ignition-onprem.JIT Access: SSH requires active re-authentication (DCF-42).Residual Risk: LOWRisk Owner: OPS-03 (Platform Admin)Status: TreatedRisk ID: R-004 | Loss of View during "Patch Tuesday"Asset: On-Prem Gateway (Production)Drata Mapping: DCF-23 (Change Management), DCF-112 (System Availability)Threat Scenario: Automated patching reboots the gateway during a critical power generation event (e.g., Synchronisation).Inherent Risk: HIGH (Operational Availability Failure).Control Measures (Implemented):Ring Deployment: Updates staged: Ring 1 (Tue) -> Ring 2 (Fri) (DCF-23).Conditional Logic: Production update conditional on Ring 1 health.Residual Risk: MEDIUMTreatment Plan: Implement "Operational Lock" script (check PLC System_Active bit) to defer updates under load.Risk Owner: OPS-02 (Platform Engineer)Status: In ProgressRisk ID: R-005 | Cloud Service Availability FailureAsset: Central SCADA Visibility (Azure Region Australia SE)Drata Mapping: DCF-113 (Backup & Recovery), DCF-112 (Availability)Threat Scenario: Catastrophic failure of the Azure Region hosting the Central Gateway.Inherent Risk: HIGH (Loss of fleet-wide billing data and centralised view).Control Measures (Implemented):On-Prem Autonomy: On-Prem Nodes are fully independent; local control persists without cloud (DCF-112).Store-and-Forward: Data buffered locally until uplink restores (DCF-113).Residual Risk: MEDIUMJustification: Acceptance of visibility loss risk as Safety/Control is not impacted.Risk Owner: OPS-03 (Platform Admin)Status: AcceptedRisk ID: R-006 | Legacy Protocol Injection (Modbus/DNP3)Asset: Level 2 PLC Network (Local LAN)Drata Mapping: DCF-102 (Network Security), DCF-105 (Segregation)Threat Scenario: Attacker on local LAN injects unauthenticated Modbus TCP commands to PLCs.Inherent Risk: CRITICAL (Direct manipulation of physical machinery).Control Measures (Implemented):Network Segmentation: Gateway OT Interface physically isolated from WAN (DCF-105).Host Firewall: UFW "Default Deny Incoming" prevents Gateway from accepting unauthorised commands (DCF-102).Residual Risk: HIGHJustification: Inherent risk of legacy hardware. Mitigation requires physical site security (fences/locks).Risk Owner: Site SuperintendentStatus: Accepted (Brownfield Constraint)Risk ID: R-007 | CI/CD Pipeline Credential LeakageAsset: GitHub Actions Runners / SecretsDrata Mapping: DCF-05 (Version Control), DCF-64 (Vuln Mgmt)Threat Scenario: Developer commits TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY to public repo or build logs.Inherent Risk: HIGH (Unauthorised entry to Overlay Network).Control Measures (Implemented):Secret Masking: GitHub Actions automatically masks registered secrets.Key Rotation: Automated monthly rotation of Ephemeral Keys.Drata Monitoring: Automated secret scanning (DCF-64).Residual Risk: LOWRisk Owner: OPS-02 (Platform Engineer)Status: TreatedRisk ID: R-008 | Time Synchronization SpoofingAsset: Historian Data Integrity (SOE Logs)Drata Mapping: DCF-111 (Time Synchronization)Threat Scenario: GPS Jamming or NTP Spoofing at remote site corrupts Sequence of Events data.Inherent Risk: MEDIUM (Forensic data unusable).Control Measures (Implemented):Stratum 2 Hierarchy: Gateways prioritize authenticated central NTP over encrypted tunnel if local GPS wavers (DCF-111).Residual Risk: LOWRisk Owner: OPS-02 (Platform Engineer)Status: Treated5.
