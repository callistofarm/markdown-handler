SecDevOps Architecture and Pipeline Setup and Operations ManualDocument IDCAU-MAN-S-001ClassificationINTERNAL CONFIDENTIALVersion1.0 (Baseline)StatusAPPROVEDOwnerHead of SecDevOps (OPS-03)DepartmentOT SecDevOpsScopeCloud/On-Prem SCADA Fleet (200+ Nodes)Effective Date12 December 2025Next Review Date12 December 2026Document ControlRevision HistoryVersionDateAuthorDescription of Changes1.012 Dec 2025Head of SecDevOps (OPS-03)Initial Release (Full Spectrum Baseline).1. PurposeThe purpose of this document is to define the high-assurance, immutable infrastructure framework for managing industrial On-Prem devices across Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific.It establishes the technical standards required to eliminate manual configuration drift by treating the Operating System and Application layers as versioned code. Furthermore, it defines the Zero Trust Overlay (Tailscale) architecture that enables secure operation over untrusted transport layers.This manual serves as the single source of truth for the "Greenfield" deployment, providing the specific configurations, scripts, and procedures necessary to rebuild the entire fleet from bare metal to production status.2. ScopeThis manual applies to all "Cloud/On-Prem SCADA" assets managed by the OT SecDevOps function.In Scope:Level 3 On-Prem Gateways: The physical compute nodes deployed at site.Level 3.5 Cloud Core: The Azure infrastructure supporting the fleet.CI/CD Pipelines: GitHub Actions workflows for OS construction and application deployment.Identity Management: Tailscale and Microsoft Entra ID integration.Out of Scope:Level 1 Control: PLC Logic and physical electrical termination.Level 4 Enterprise: ERP systems and Corporate IT endpoints.3. Normative References & ComplianceThis architecture is designed "Secure by Design" to meet the following controls. All technical configurations in this manual are mapped to these requirements.FrameworkControl / FunctionImplementation MechanismISO 27001:2022A.8.32 (Change management)Jira "Verified Move" workflow enforcing build verification before UAT.ISO 27001:2022A.8.25 (Secure development lifecycle)Infrastructure-as-Code (Packer), Container Signing (Cosign), and automated GitOps testing.ISO 27001:2022A.8.20 (Networks security)Zero Trust Overlay (Tailscale) independent of physical transport.ISO 27001:2022A.8.22 (Segregation of networks)Strict Micro-segmentation (ACLs) and Local Firewall (UFW) default deny.ISO 27001:2022A.5.15 (Access control)Tailscale SSH (Just-in-Time) eliminates static credentials.NIST CSF v2.0GOVERN (GV)Governance via GitHub CODEOWNERS separating Platform vs. Project roles.NIST CSF v2.0PROTECT (PR)Immutable OS images, Device Isolation via Defender for Endpoint.IEC 62443-4-1SD-1 (Secure Development Process)Automated pipelines with SAST (Dependabot) and SCA.4.

Architectural High-Level DesignThe system adheres to a modified Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA), bridging OT (Level 2/3) and Cloud (Level 3.5/4) via secure, encrypted tunnels.Level 3.5 (Cloud Core)Hosted in Microsoft Azure (Australia South-East).Contains the Central SCADA Gateway, SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel), Monitoring Core (Zabbix/Grafana), and Artefact Repositories (GHCR).Level 3 (On-Prem DMZ)The Industrial On-Prem Gateway (Ubuntu LTS). Acts as the secure boundary.Runs the Containerised Workload and Zero Trust Agent.Connectivity: Maintains strictly filtered egress paths for NTP Time Synchronisation (Stratum 2) and Ignition Licensing verification. All other inbound/outbound traffic is routed via the Encrypted Overlay.Level 2 (Control)PLCs and Legacy HMIs. These devices have no direct internet access.They communicate solely with the Level 3 On-Prem Gateway via the local LAN.6. Technical Standards: Full Stack Definition6.1 Hardware Specifications6.1.1 On-Prem Panel (Small)Model: Advantech UNO-137 (or equivalent x86_64 Industrial PC).BIOS Configuration:Restore AC Power Loss: Power On (Critical for unmanned sites).Watchdog Timer: Enabled.Secure Boot: Enabled (Keys enrolled during provisioning).Virtualization Technology (VT-x): Enabled.6.1.2 Standard (Medium/Large)Model: Advantech MIC-770V3.BIOS Configuration: Same as On-Prem Panel.6.2 OS and Virtualisation Layers6.2.1 Host OSDistro: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (Minimal).Hardening: CIS Level 1 Benchmark.6.2.2 Kernel Tuning (sysctl.conf)Refer to [CAU-STD-S-003] Section 2.1 for the definitive Kernel Tuning Configuration.6.3 Containerisation Strategy6.3.1 Universal Image StrategyBase Image: inductiveautomation/ignition:8.3.0.Risk Mitigation: All 8.3.0 deployments are gated by a mandatory 14-day Soak Test in the UAT environment.License Scope: Deployed with Ignition Edge license for On-Prem Panel applications.6.3.2 Persistence ArchitectureThe filesystem layout ensures separation of Mutable State (logs, cache) from Immutable Code (projects, logic).State Volume: gateway-data:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data.Bind Mount: ./projects:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data/config/resources/external/projects:ro (Read-Only).7.
