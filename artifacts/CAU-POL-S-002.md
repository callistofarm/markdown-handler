Purpose and Scope1.1 Policy StatementThis policy mandates the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) architecture and Identity Governance standards for the COMPANY Australia SCADA Cloud/On-Prem SCADA software stack. It enforces the Principle of Least Privilege, ensuring that access rights are granted only to the minimum extent necessary to perform authorised job functions.The objective is to strictly enforce logical segregation between:Operational Technology (OT): Real-time SCADA control systems.Information Technology (IT): Infrastructure code and cloud management.Governance (GOV): Sensitive personnel data and audit logging.1.2 ScopeThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, and automated systems accessing the Cloud/On-Prem SCADA ecosystem (Development, Test, Production).In-Scope Systems:Identity Providers: Microsoft Entra ID (Internal Staff) and Azure AD B2C (External Customers).SCADA Application: IA Ignition.Infrastructure: Portainer (Docker fleet), Zero Trust Overlay (Tailscale), Azure Arc.DevOps Tooling: GitHub Enterprise, Jira, Confluence.Observability: Zabbix, Grafana, Microsoft Sentinel.Compliance: Drata.2. Identity Governance FrameworkThe organisation shall utilise a Dual-Identity Provider (IDP) Strategy to maintain a hard security boundary between customer access and infrastructure administration.2.1 Identity Provider RequirementsCustomer Access (External): All external users (IGN Track) must be provisioned exclusively in Azure AD B2C. They shall have no network route or login capability to the underlying OS, Cloud Portal, or Source Code repositories.Staff Access (Internal): All internal personnel (OPS/GOV Tracks) and Service Principals (SVC) must be provisioned in Microsoft Entra ID. These identities are subject to mandatory HRIS verification and MFA enforcement.2.2 Role Hierarchy & DefinitionsAccess rights shall be assigned according to the following defined tracks. Ad-hoc or "custom" permission sets are prohibited.PrefixTrackLevelUser TypeIDPPolicy DefinitionSVCService00Service PrincipalMicrosoft Entra IDNon-Human Identity. Accounts used by automation agents.

Provisioning & Lifecycle Management4.1 Internal Staff ProvisioningAuthorisation: All account creation requests must originate from an authorised ticket in the Service Desk system.Group Assignment: Users must be assigned to one primary Security Group. Direct assignment of permissions to user accounts is prohibited.SEC-OT-OPS-03-ADMINSEC-OT-OPS-02-ENGSEC-OT-OPS-01-VIEWSEC-OT-GOV-01-HRSEC-OT-GOV-02-AUDITSegregation of Duties: The GOV-01 (HR) role shall not hold OPS-02 or OPS-03 permissions to prevent conflict of interest between operations and personnel oversight.4.2 External Customer ProvisioningMapping: Mapping of B2C identities to Ignition Security Levels (cust_viewer, cust_operator) must be performed manually by an OPS-03 Admin to ensure human validation of the contract scope.Review: Customer access rights shall be reviewed semi-annually.4.3 Deprovisioning (Offboarding)Immediate Revocation: Upon termination of employment or contract, the user's Microsoft Entra ID account must be disabled immediately.Token Expiry: Access to all downstream systems (Tailscale, GitHub) must terminate automatically within 1 hour of the Entra ID revocation via SCIM or SSO token expiry.Offline On-Prem Exception: For disconnected On-Prem Nodes (e.g., satellite fade), revocation SHALL take effect immediately upon the restoration of network connectivity. Physical site access controls SHALL mitigate risks during the disconnected period.5. Security Hardening RequirementsTo protect privileged access, the following controls shall be enforced via Conditional Access Policies for all OPS-03 (Admin) and GOV-01 (HR) accounts.ConditionControl RequirementPolicy RationaleAuthentication MethodPhishing-Resistant MFAAll privileged access must use FIDO2/WebAuthn (YubiKey) or Certificate-Based Auth. SMS/Voice MFA is prohibited.Device ComplianceCompliant Device RequiredAccess to Azure, Entra ID, and GitHub is restricted to organisation-managed, compliant devices (Intune).Vendor Device ExceptionVDI / Jump HostExceptions for 3rd Party Vendor devices MUST be managed via a Conditional Access Policy granting restricted, time-bound access (e.g., Virtual Desktop Infrastructure or Jump Host).Network LocationTrusted Network OnlyAdministrative access is permitted only from the corporate VPN (Tailscale) or designated static IPs.Session Frequency1-Hour Re-authManagement sessions for Azure and Sentinel shall time out after 1 hour of inactivity.Emergency ExceptionBreak Glass ProtocolDuring active Severity-1 Incidents, session timeouts MAY be extended or bypassed via the activation of the Emergency 'Break Glass' Account to ensure continuous operational visibility.Legacy ProtocolsBlock AllIMAP, SMTP, and POP3 protocols must be blocked for all users to prevent bypass of MFA.6. Policy Enforcement & AuditAudit Logging: All changes to Group Memberships and Conditional Access Policies shall be logged to Microsoft Sentinel and retained for 365 days.Compliance Monitoring: Drata shall be configured to automatically monitor the membership of SEC-OT groups and alert on unauthorised additions.Violations: Any user found circumventing these controls may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
