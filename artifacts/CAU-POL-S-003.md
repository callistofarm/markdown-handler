Aligned to OPS-xx Role Model.1. Policy Statement and PurposeThis policy mandates the secure creation, management, storage, and rotation of all authentication credentials utilised within the COMPANY Australia Cloud/On-Prem SCADA ecosystem. It establishes LastPass Enterprise as the authoritative "Vault of Record" for shared secrets.The policy enforces a Zero Trust approach to credential management, ensuring that:Human Identity is verified via rigorous Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).Shared Secrets (e.g., PLC passwords, API keys) are cryptographically secured, version-controlled, and audited.OT Availability is preserved via managed offline access protocols.2. ScopeThis policy applies to all Internal Staff (OPS-xx/GOV-xx), Contractors, and Automated Systems (SVC-xx) requiring access to corporate assets.In-Scope Assets:User Credentials: SSO passwords, LastPass Master Passwords.Infrastructure Secrets: Root keys, Database connection strings, Azure Service Principal secrets.OT Secrets: PLC program passwords, HMI maintenance logins, On-Prem Gateway auth keys.3.

Ensures no secrets exist in code/text files.Responsible for "Secrets Management" hygiene.4. Identity Management & Integration4.1 Master Password & SSO (ISO 27001 A.9.4.2)Mandatory SSO: Access to the LastPass vault SHALL be authenticated exclusively via Microsoft Entra ID SSO. Direct login using a separate email/password is prohibited for standard users.MFA Enforcement: The underlying Microsoft Entra ID account MUST utilize Phishing-Resistant MFA (Microsoft Authenticator Number Matching or FIDO2 key).Master Password: Users SHALL set a unique, complex Master Password (min 14 characters) that is NEVER stored digitally or reused.4.2 Offline Access Mandate (OT Availability)Policy Statement: To ensure continuity of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) during a cloud outage:The "Permit Offline Access" policy SHALL be enabled for all OPS-02 and OPS-03 roles.Operational staff MUST synchronise their vault at least once every 14 days to ensure local cache availability for emergency response.5. Password Complexity & Rotation Standards (ISO 27001 A.9.4.3)5.1 Standard Complexity RequirementsAll credentials generated for cloud-native or modern IT systems SHALL meet the following criteria:RequirementPolicyRationaleLengthMinimum 16 charactersResilience against brute-force / rainbow table attacks.Complexity"Mix of Upper, Lower, Number, Symbol"Prevention of dictionary attacks.UniquenessMandatoryReuse of passwords across different services is strictly prohibited.GenerationAutomatedPasswords SHOULD be generated via the LastPass generator, not human creation.5.2 OT Legacy Exception (Technical Constraint)For legacy Industrial Control Systems (e.g., PLCs, HMIs, RTUs) that have hard-coded limits on password length or character sets:Exception: Passwords MAY deviate from Section 5.1 to match the maximum capability of the device.Compensating Control: Such devices MUST be isolated behind the Zero Trust Overlay (Tailscale) or a localized firewall to prevent network-based brute force attempts.5.3 Rotation PolicySSO Passwords: Rotated every 180 days (Managed by Entra ID Policy).Service Accounts: Rotated every 180 days or immediately upon staff departure.OT Device Passwords: Rotated annually or upon vendor contract termination.6. Secrets Management Guidelines6.1 Personal vs. Corporate VaultsBusiness Vault: Users SHALL use their Enterprise Vault for all business-related credentials.Separation: Personal credentials (e.g., personal banking) SHOULD be stored in a linked Personal Account, ensuring they remain accessible to the user if they leave the organisation.6.2 Shared Engineering Secrets (Mandatory Storage)For all project secrets (API Keys, Root Credentials, Encryption Keys):Storage: Secrets MUST be stored exclusively in the designated "Engineering Shared Folder" within LastPass.Prohibition: Storing shared secrets in the following locations is STRICTLY PROHIBITED:Source Code (Git).Unencrypted text files / Spreadsheets.Teams/Slack Chat channels.Wiki Pages (Confluence).Access Control: Access to the Engineering Shared Folder is restricted to OPS-02 and OPS-03 roles and SHALL be reviewed quarterly (via [CAU-SOP-S-004]).7. Governance & Compliance Monitoring (ISO 27001 A.18)7.1 Automated Monitoring (Drata)Compliance is continuously monitored via the Drata GRC platform, tracking:MFA Status: 100% enforcement verification.Vault Health: Security Score > 85/100.Admin Count: Verification that Super Admin privileges are limited to <3 users.7.2 Non-ComplianceAny violation of this policy—specifically the sharing of Master Passwords or the plaintext storage of project secrets—constitutes a critical security incident. Offenders act in breach of the Information Security Policy and may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
