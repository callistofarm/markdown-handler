OT Cloud Computing Security StandardDocument IDCAU-STD-S-002ClassificationINTERNAL CONFIDENTIALVersion1.0 (Baseline)StatusAPPROVEDOwnerHead of SecDevOps (OPS-03)DepartmentOT SecDevOpsScopeAzure Cloud Core & CI/CD Control PlaneEffective Date12 December 2025Next Review Date12 December 2026Document ControlRevision HistoryVersionDateAuthorDescription of Changes1.012 Dec 2025Head of SecDevOps (OPS-03)Baseline Release. Consolidated previous drafts into a single approved baseline.1. PurposeThe purpose of this standard is to define the mandatory security configuration for the "Level 3.5" Cloud Core infrastructure. As the central command and control plane for the SCADA fleet, the Cloud Core must adhere to strict governance to prevent supply chain attacks and lateral movement to the OT On-Prem environment. This standard establishes the baseline for Identity (Entra ID), Network (Azure VNet), and Pipeline (GitHub) security.2. ScopeThis standard applies to the following Cloud Assets managed by the OT SecDevOps function:Identity Provider: Microsoft Entra ID (Organization Level - Scoped via Security Groups).Infrastructure Provider: Microsoft Azure (Subscription Level - Australia East).CI/CD Control Plane: GitHub Enterprise (Organization Level).Artifact Storage: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and Azure Blob Storage.3. Normative References & ComplianceThe cloud architecture is validated against the following controls.FrameworkControl / FunctionImplementation MechanismISO 27001:2022A.5.15 (Access control)Conditional Access Policies (MFA + Device Compliance).ISO 27001:2022A.8.24 (Use of cryptography)Terraform State Encryption (Customer Managed Keys).ISO 27001:2022A.8.32 (Change management)Branch Protection Rules & Signed Commits.ISO 27001:2022A.8.12 (Data leakage prevention)Private Endpoints for Storage Accounts & Key Vaults.NIST CSF v2.0PROTECT (PR)Least Privilege RBAC via PIM (Privileged Identity Management).NIST CSF v2.0DETECT (DE)Centralised logging via Microsoft Sentinel.4. Identity & Access Management Standards4.1 Entra ID Configuration (Group Scoped)Objective: Prevent unauthorized access to the control plane using strictly scoped security groups.Group Naming Standard: All OT-managed groups must be prefixed sg-scada- (e.g., sg-scada-admins, sg-scada-operators).MFA Enforcement: All users within sg-scada-* groups must enforce Multi-Factor Authentication.Conditional Access Policies (CAP):Scope: Policies must be assigned to SCADA Security Groups, not the entire tenant.CAP-01 [Admin]: Require Phishing-Resistant MFA (FIDO2/YubiKey) for sg-scada-admins and sg-scada-approvers.CAP-02 [Geo-Block]: Block sign-ins to SCADA Apps originating outside of Australia and New Zealand.CAP-03 [Device]: Block access to Azure Portal for sg-scada-* members from non-compliant/unmanaged devices.4.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)Objective: Enforce Least Privilege (NIST PR.AC-6).Permanent Assignments: strictly limited to Reader roles for sg-scada-viewers.Privileged Identity Management (PIM):Contributor/Owner: Access must be Just-in-Time (JIT) enabled for sg-scada-admins.Activation: Max duration 4 hours.Requirement: Ticket Number/Justification required for activation.Approval: Peer approval required for Owner elevation.5. Cloud Network Security Standards5.1 Virtual Network (VNet) TopologyRegion: Australia East (Primary).Address Space: 10.50.0.0/16 (Distinct from all On-Prem subnets to prevent routing conflicts).Subnet Segmentation:snet-gateway (10.50.1.0/24): Central SCADA Gateway (Ignition).snet-connect (10.50.2.0/24): Tailscale Subnet Routers & Bastions.snet-data (10.50.3.0/24): Private Endpoints (Storage, Key Vault, DB).AzureBastionSubnet (10.50.255.0/24): Microsoft managed management plane.5.2 Network Security Groups (NSG)All Subnets must have an associated NSG. The default rule is Deny All Inbound/Outbound.Standard NSG Ruleset (nsg-core-standard):PriorityDirectionNameProtocolPortSourceDestinationActionNote100InboundAllow_Tailscale_UDPUDP41641AnyAnyAllowDirect Mesh110InboundAllow_Ignition_GANTCP8060100.64.0.0/1010.50.1.0/24AllowGAN Sync (via TS)120InboundAllow_SSH_JITTCP2210.50.2.0/24AnyAllowBastion Access100OutboundAllow_Azure_ServicesTCP443AnyAzureCloudAllowAPI Access110OutboundAllow_NTPUDP123AnyInternetAllowTime Sync4096OutboundDeny_All_OutboundAnyAnyAnyAnyDenyExfiltration Protection6. Supply Chain & CI/CD Security6.1 GitHub Organization Settings2FA: Required for all members.Repository Visibility: Private by default. Internal allowed for shared libraries. Public forbidden.Base Permissions: No Permission (Read access must be explicitly granted).6.2 Artifact Integrity (GHCR)Visibility: Private.Immutable Tags: Enabled. Overwriting image tags (e.g., v1.0.1) is forbidden to prevent injection attacks.Vulnerability Scanning: Container Analysis (Trivy) enabled.Gate: Images with CRITICAL or HIGH CVEs (CVSS > 7.0) must not be deployable to Production.6.3 Branch Protection Rules (Main/Production)Require Pull Request Reviews: Minimum 1 approval.Require Status Checks:Terraform Plan (Must pass).Trivy Scan (Must pass).Packer Validate (Must pass).Require Signed Commits: Strictly Enforced (GPG/SSH).6.4 Dependency Management (SCA)Objective: Detect vulnerable libraries within source code (ISO 27001 A.8.25).Tool: GitHub Dependabot.Configuration:Frequency: Daily scan.Target Ecosystems: docker (Dockerfile), pip (Python), npm (Javascript), terraform.Policy:CRITICAL and HIGH severity alerts must be remediated within 7 days.Pull Requests generated by Dependabot must undergo standard CI validation (Tests/Trivy) before merge.7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security7.1 Terraform State ManagementThe Terraform State file (.tfstate) contains sensitive data (keys, passwords) and must be treated as a "Tier 0" asset.Storage: Azure Storage Account (Blob).Encryption: Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) stored in Key Vault.Network: Access restricted to Private Endpoint only. Public internet access to the Storage Account is Disabled.Versioning: Enabled (to recover from corruption/malicious deletion).Soft Delete: Enabled (365 Days).8. Monitoring & Threat Detection8.1 Microsoft Sentinel ConfigurationObjective: Centralised aggregation of security events (ISO 27001 A.8.15).Data Connectors:Azure Activity: Enabled (Control Plane logs).Azure Active Directory: Enabled (Audit & Sign-in logs).Syslog (via AMA): Enabled (Collection from Tailscale Subnet Routers).GitHub: Enabled (Audit log streaming).8.2 Log Retention PolicyHot Path (Sentinel): 90 Days (Interactive Query).Cold Path (Archive): 365 Days (Blob Storage - Immutable WORM policy).8.3 "Break Glass" AlertingSentinel Analytics Rules must be configured to trigger High Severity Incidents for the following indicators:Break Glass Script Execution: Detection of BREAK_GLASS_ACTIVATED string in Syslog.PIM Elevation: Any activation of Global Administrator role.Network Anomaly: Outbound traffic from On-Prem Subnets to known Malicious IPs (Threat Intelligence).Impossible Travel: Sign-in events from geographically distant locations within a short timeframe.9.
