Aligned to OPS-xx Role Model.1. Purpose and Scope1.1 Policy StatementThis policy mandates the configuration, operation, and governance of the Zero Trust Overlay (Tailscale) within the COMPANY Australia Cloud/On-Prem SCADA stack. It enforces ISO 27001 Clause A.13.1 (Network Security Management) by ensuring that all network connections are authenticated, authorised, and encrypted, regardless of the underlying physical transport.The organisation SHALL operate the Tailnet under a strict "Default Deny" posture. No node, user, or service is trusted implicitly based on physical location or IP address.1.2 ScopeThis policy applies to all Human Users (OPS Track), Machine Nodes (SVC Track), and External Interconnects accessing the overlay network.In-Scope Components:Control Plane: Tailscale Coordination Server (SaaS).Data Plane: WireGuard encrypted tunnels between On-Prem Gateways, Cloud Servers, and Operator Workstations.Access Controls: Network ACLs (HuJSON) and Tag-based routing.2. Zero Trust Architecture (Technical Standards)2.1 Default Deny MandateThe Tailscale Access Control List (ACL) SHALL be configured to deny all traffic by default.Wildcard Prohibition: Rules permitting * to * are strictly prohibited.Explicit Allow: Connectivity SHALL be granted only via explicit accept rules targeting specific Tags or User Groups.2.2 Network Segmentation (A.8.22)The Tailnet SHALL enforce strict micro-segmentation to prevent lateral movement (Ransomware/Intrusion).Production Isolation: Nodes tagged tag:prod MUST NOT accept connections from tag:dev or tag:test.Tenant Isolation: Customer-specific subnets (Site-to-Site) MUST be isolated using the Tailscale isolation property to prevent cross-tenant visibility.Critical OT Air-Gap: Direct routing from the Tailnet to the Level 2 PLC LAN is prohibited unless proxied via a secure gateway service (e.g., Ignition/Zabbix Proxy).3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & ACLsAccess to the Tailnet is governed by the Role Hierarchy defined in [CAU-POL-S-002]. The following mapping defines the mandatory ACL permissions for each role.3.1 Role to ACL MappingSecurity LevelRole ID [CAU-POL-S-002]Tailscale RoleACL Access ScopeLevel 5OPS-03 (Admin)AdminFull Access. Authorised to manage users, devices, and edit the ACL Policy file. Subject to Two-Person Rule for major changes.Level 4OPS-02 (Engineer)MemberOperational Access. Read/Write access to tag:prod and tag:dev services required for engineering duties. No console admin rights.Level 3OPS-01 (Viewer)MemberRestricted Access. Access strictly limited to tag:test environments and specific monitoring endpoints (Zabbix Web). No production SSH access.Level 2EXT-01 (Vendor/Site)MemberInterconnect Only. Highly segmented access defined by unique Project Tags. Restricted to specific Site-to-Site tunnel endpoints. No access to Core Infrastructure.Level 1SVC-00 (Automation)MemberLeast Privilege. Automated agents (CI/CD Runners). Access limited to specific target IPs/Ports required for deployment (e.g., Port 22/443).3.2 Privileged Access Requirements (OPS-03)Personnel assigned to the Platform Admin (OPS-03) role hold "Keys to the Kingdom". They SHALL satisfy the following criteria per ISO 27001 A.9.2:Management Approval: Documented sign-off from the Head of Security.Background Check: Verification of Enhanced Screening status (HRIS).Training: Completion of the "Zero Trust Admin" competency unit.MFA Mandate: Phishing-Resistant MFA (YubiKey/WebAuthn) enforced on the underlying Identity Provider account.4. Operational Procedures4.1 ACL Change Management ([CAU-SOP-S-003])All changes to the Tailscale Policy File (policy.hujson) SHALL follow a GitOps workflow:Proposal: Engineer submits a Pull Request (PR) to the tailscale-acls repository.Validation: Automated CI pipeline validates JSON syntax and runs tailscale acl check against negative tests (e.g., "Ensure Dev cannot reach Prod").Approval: Changes require peer review and approval from an OPS-03 Admin.Deployment: Upon merge, the pipeline automatically pushes the new policy to the Tailscale API. Manual editing in the Web Console is prohibited.4.2 Lifecycle ManagementOnboarding: Access is provisioned automatically via SCIM groups in Microsoft Entra ID. Direct user creation in Tailscale is prohibited.Offboarding: Revocation of Microsoft Entra ID rights MUST trigger immediate termination of Tailscale sessions.Key Rotation: Reusable Auth Keys (e.g., for Packer) SHALL be rotated every 90 days. Ephemeral Keys (CI/CD) SHALL be rotated every 30 days.5. Risk Management & Compliance5.1 OT Safety Interlock (Critical)To prevent operational disruption during active incidents:Kill Switch: The Head of SecDevOps (OPS-03) SHALL maintain the ability to globally revoke specific tags or nodes instantly via the Admin Console to sever a compromised link.Break Glass: In the event of Identity Provider failure (Microsoft Entra ID outage), a local "Emergency Access" key SHALL be physically secured in the corporate safe to allow administrative recovery.5.2 Compliance Monitoring (Drata)The following controls are automated via the Drata GRC integration:DCF-102 (Network Security): Drata monitors the ACL file for "Any/Any" rules.DCF-42 (Access Control): Drata reconciles the list of Tailscale users against the Microsoft Entra ID "Authorized Staff" group daily.DCF-56 (Logging): Tailscale Network Flow Logs (NetFlow) SHALL be ingested into Microsoft Sentinel for threat hunting and anomaly detection.
