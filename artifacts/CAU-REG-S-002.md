Context and Scope1.1 PurposeThis Statement of Applicability (SoA) defines the specific information security controls implemented by COMPANY Australia to mitigate risks identified in the Information Security Risk Register ([CAU-REG-S-001]). It serves as the primary link between the Risk Assessment and the implemented SecDevOps architecture for the Cloud/On-Prem SCADA stack.1.2 ScopeThis SoA applies to the Cloud/On-Prem SCADA Fleet Management System, including:Cloud Core: Azure Region (Australia South-East).On-Prem: On-Prem Gateways (Ubuntu LTS) and OT Networks.Pipeline: GitHub Enterprise CI/CD and Container Registry.Identity: Microsoft Entra ID and Azure AD B2C.2. Applicability MatrixThe following table maps ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls to the specific technical mechanisms defined in the SecDevOps Architecture Manual ([CAU-MAN-S-001]) and Identity Policy ([CAU-POL-S-002]).Legend:App: Applicable (Yes/No)Imp: Implemented (Full/Implemented*/Shared)ISO 27001 ControlControl NameAppImpImplementation Description (Evidence)Justification for InclusionDrata DCF RefA.5.14Information TransferYesFullSecure Transport: All internal file transfers (Backups/Logs) occur exclusively via encrypted Zero Trust Overlay (Tailscale) Tunnels (WireGuard). External alerting (Email) utilises enforced TLS 1.2+ SMTP relays.Essential for secure operations (Backups) and Incident Response (Alerts).DCF-108A.5.15Access ControlYesFullTailscale SSH (JIT): Access is ephemeral and authenticated via Microsoft Entra ID. No static SSH keys exist on disk. Access is revoked immediately upon IDP disablement.Essential to prevent unauthorised root access to SCADA gateways. Mitigates R-003.DCF-42A.5.23Cloud Services SecurityYesFullInfrastructure-as-Code (Terraform): Explicit definition of Azure (L3.5) and On-Prem (L3) boundaries. Managed via encrypted state files.Required to manage shared responsibility model in Azure.DCF-88A.7.4Physical Security MonitoringYesSharedShared Responsibility: Software detects disconnection/tampering (Hardware Watchdog/Defender). COMPANY provides tamper-evident seals for On-Prem Nodes. Customer is responsible for site perimeter (Fences/Locks).Critical for remote On-Prem Nodes (R-002, R-006). Residual risk communicated via SLA.DCF-27A.8.8Tech Vulnerability MgmtYesFullAutomated Gating: GitHub Dependabot scans code/containers. MS Defender scans Host OS. High/Critical CVSS scores (>7.0) automatically block the CI pipeline.Critical to prevent supply chain attacks (R-001).DCF-64A.8.12Data Leakage PreventionYesImplemented *Network Egress Filtering: Strict UFW rules prevent unauthorised outbound connections. Partial Gap: "Break Glass" mode DLP. Handled via Risk Acceptance R-00X.Required to protect proprietary historian data.DCF-91A.8.15LoggingYesFullImmutable Logs: Syslog/Auth.log collection via Azure Arc to MS Sentinel. Storage Policy enabled for 365 days (Cold Tier) with Read-Only locks.Forensic requirement for post-incident analysis (R-008).DCF-56A.8.20Network SecurityYesFullZero Trust Overlay: Tailscale separates the security layer from the physical transport (Starlink/4G). All inter-node traffic is encrypted (WireGuard).Ensures confidentiality over untrusted transport layers.DCF-102A.8.22Segregation of NetworksYesFullMicro-segmentation: Tailscale ACLs (HuJSON) enforce strict "Tag" based isolation. On-Prem Nodes cannot communicate laterally. Default Deny ingress.Prevents lateral movement of ransomware (R-003).DCF-105A.8.25Secure Development LifecycleYesFullImmutable Infrastructure: OS built via Packer. Containers signed via Cosign. GitOps ensures the runtime matches the repo state exactly.Prevents configuration drift and unauthorised changes.DCF-15A.8.28Secure CodingYesImplemented *SAST: Dependabot and CodeQL active. Partial Gap: DAST for Python. Handled via Risk Treatment Plan RTP-00X.Required to prevent introduction of vulnerabilities via code.DCF-16A.8.32Change ManagementYesFullTraceability: Jira "Verified Move" workflow linked to GitHub Commits. "Canary" builds validate changes in Ring 1 before Ring 2 promotion.Ensures stability of critical infrastructure updates (R-004).DCF-233. Exclusion JustificationsThe following controls have been evaluated and deemed Not Applicable to the current scope.None. All controls are applicable to the Scope of the ISMS. Where a control is handled by a parent entity (e.g., Legal/HR) or the Customer (Physical Site), it is marked as 'Shared' or 'Supported by Corporate/Customer'.4.
